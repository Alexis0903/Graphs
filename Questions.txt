Can we find a cycle in any graph (assuming that there is at least one) in polynomial time ?
If a cycle containing all points is optimal from one starting vertice, is it optimal for all vertices ?
Is partinioning the graph is clusters (maybe with Louvain method), finding the shortest path within and then linking the clusters a good strategy ?
Would starting from a cycle and then adding vertices one by one be a good strategy ?
